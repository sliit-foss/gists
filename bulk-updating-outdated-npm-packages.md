# Updating Outdated npm Packages with pnpm

This command sequence updates all outdated npm packages in a project to their latest versions using pnpm. Below is a breakdown of each part of the command:

```sh
npm outdated | cut -d" " -f1 | tail -n +2 | sed 's/$/@latest/' | xargs pnpm i
```

## Command Breakdown

### `npm outdated`
- Lists all the dependencies that are outdated in your project.
- Outputs details such as the current version, wanted version, and latest version available for each package.

### `cut -d" " -f1`
- `cut` is used to extract specific fields from each line of input.
- `-d" "` sets the delimiter to a space character.
- `-f1` extracts the first field, which is the package name.

### `tail -n +2`
- `tail` outputs the last part of files.
- `-n +2` tells `tail` to start from the second line, skipping the header line from `npm outdated`.

### `sed 's/$/@latest/'`
- `sed` is a stream editor for parsing and transforming text.
- `s/$/@latest/` substitutes the end of each line (`$`) with `@latest`, appending `@latest` to each package name.

### `xargs pnpm i`
- `xargs` builds and executes command lines from standard input.
- `pnpm i` (or `pnpm install`) is the pnpm command to install packages.
- `xargs` takes the list of packages generated by the previous commands and runs `pnpm i` for each one, installing the latest version of each outdated package.

## Example

Consider a project with the following outdated packages:

```sh
$ npm outdated
Package  Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
lodash    4.17.15  4.17.21  4.17.21  myproject
express   4.17.1   4.17.1   4.18.2   myproject
```
Running the command:

```shell
npm outdated | cut -d" " -f1 | tail -n +2 | sed 's/$/@latest/' | xargs pnpm i
```

Will install the latest versions of lodash and express:

```sh
pnpm i lodash@latest express@latest
```

This updates lodash to 4.17.21 and express to 4.18.2.

This command sequence is a convenient way to update all outdated packages in your project to their latest versions.
